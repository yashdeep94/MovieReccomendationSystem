# Backend and frontend are implemented separately in this project
Backend uses django and frontend uses react.js
# For movie data I have used movielens dataset
# In order to populate database there is a script which is currently commented out just uncomment that and then run server and hit url to populate data into database
Script is located inside the `movie_reccommendation` folder under views.py
